<ul>
Designer's Notes on making the website:
    
<li>Homepage: needs Overview on how and or why we made dis collab in the first place</li>
<li>Members Page: should contain all the profiles for each member here in the collab</li>
<li>Github Page: should contain a detailed information of all the things tutorials/instructions on how to Setup Github, etc.</li>
<li>Portfolio Page: similar to members page but but this one needs to be just like personal website profile links with screenshots showcasing each member's website or smth</li>
    </ul>

<p>I think that's all for now :3</p>
